Figure 10, the downtime of migration is nearly constant with
increasing sequence lengths (roughly 20-30 ms), even shorter
than a single decode step. In comparison, the downtimes of
baselines increase with the sequence lengths, reaching up
to 111Ã— that of migration. For example, recomputing an 8k
sequence for LLaMA-30B takes 3.5s, which translates to a
service stall similar to 54 decode steps.
Figure 10 also compares the per-step decode times during
migration on the source instance with that during normal execution (results on the destination are mostly similar). We
observe up to 1% performance differences for both LLaMA7B and LLaMA-30B, showing the negligible migration overhead. Also note that such overhead exists only when there are
requests being migrated (in or out) on an instance. We find
that in all the serving experiments in the following sections,
the average fraction of time span with ongoing migration for
each instance is only roughly 10%.
