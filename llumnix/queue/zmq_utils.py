    The client can be closed, which closes the ZMQ context. This normally
    happens on server shutdown. In some cases, methods like abort and
    do_log_stats will still be called and then try to open a socket, which
    causes a ZMQError and creates a huge stack trace.
    So, we throw this error such that we can suppress it.
